<h1>ProximoBus Documentation</h1>

<h2>Fundamentals</h2>

<p>ProximoBus is a read-only REST API. Data is retrieved by sending an HTTP GET
request to an appropriate URL. No authentication is required, and there are
no write operations so you don't need to worry about PUT and POST.</p>

<p>If you're using Firefox and you'd like to view the JSON examples in your
browser, you may find it useful to install <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10869">the JSONView add-on</a>.</p>

<h2>Supported Data Formats</h2>

<p>A response format is selected by appending an extension to the end of the endpoints described below.
This is done by appending a period and then one of the format keywords from the table below.</p>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Keyword</th>
    <th>MIME Type</th>
    <th>Format Name</th>
    <th>Remarks</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>json</tt></td>
    <td><tt>application/json</tt></td>
    <td><a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a></td>
    <td>This is the primary data format used by ProximoBus.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>js</tt></td>
    <td><tt>text/javascript</tt></td>
    <td>JavaScript</td>
    <td>
      Allows cross-site requests via the JSON-P convention.
      Provide a <tt>callback</tt> query string argument containing the name
      of your JavaScript callback function.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>kml</tt></td>
    <td><tt>application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml</tt></td>
    <td><a href="http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/">KML</a></td>
    <td>A geographical data format supported only for stops and vehicles. This format can be used to add a "Network Link" to <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a>. Only the location and a display name of the retrieved items are available at this time.</td>

<h2>Data Endpoints</h2>



<h3>List of agencies</h3>

<p>URL: <tt>/agencies</tt></p>

<p>Returns a list of agencies that can be queries via this API. Not all agencies
that use NextBus are available; only a subset of agencies that have elected
to make available a public data feed are accessible via the public NextBus endpoints
that ProximoBus uses.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/agencies.json">List of agencies in JSON</a></li>
</ul>



<h3>Properties of a specific agency</h3>

<p>URL: <tt>/agencies/<var>id</var></tt></p>

<p>Returns an object representing the single selected agency.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/agencies/sf-muni.json">San Francisco Muni in JSON</a></li>
</ul>



<h3>List of routes for an agency</h3>

<p>URL: <tt>/agencies/<var>id</var>/routes</tt></p>

<p>Returns a list of routes operated by the selected agency. For some
agencies only a subset of the available routes may be integrated
with NextBus.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/agencies/sf-muni/routes.json">Routes operated by San Francisco Muni in JSON</a></li>
</ul>



<h3>Properties of a specific route</h3>

<p>URL: <tt>/agencies/<var>id</var>/routes/<var>id</var></tt></p>

<p>Returns an object representing the selected route.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/agencies/sf-muni/routes/N.json">Muni's N-Judah line in JSON</a></li>
</ul>




<h3>List of stops on a route</h3>

<p>URL: <tt>/agencies/<var>id</var>/routes/<var>id</var>/stops</tt></p>

<p>Returns a list of stops on the selected route. This list is the union
of all stops serviced by all runs of this route, and is in no particular
order. To get an ordered list of stops one must request the stops for
a particular run.</p>

<p>The stops for the two directions of a bidirectional route are often
returned as two separate stops. However, sometimes a terminal
of a route may be represented by the same stop in both directions.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/agencies/sf-muni/routes/F/stops.json">List of stops for Muni's F-Market&amp;Wharves line in JSON</a></li>
  <li><a href="/agencies/sf-muni/routes/F/stops.kml">List of stops for Muni's F-Market&amp;Wharves line in KML</a></li>
</ul>




<h3>List of runs for a route</h3>

<p>URL: <tt>/agencies/<var>id</var>/routes/<var>id</var>/runs</tt></p>

<p>Returns a list of runs for the selected route. A run describes
a sequence of stops between two terminals. Most routes have at
least two runs, and many have additional runs used at specific
times of day, such as when a vehicle does a short run when it is about
to return to its garage.</p>

<p>The primary runs that passengers think of as the standard sequence
of stops for this route are indicated by the <tt>display_in_ui</tt> flag
being set to true. If you're displaying a list of runs as part of
a drill-down to predictions for a particular stop then you should
generally show only the primary runs. The properties of the non-primary
runs are useful for rendering destination information for predicted
vehicles.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/agencies/sf-muni/routes/6/runs.json">List of runs for Muni's 6-Parnassus line in JSON</a></li>
</ul>




<h3>Properties of a specific run</h3>

<p>URL: <tt>/agencies/<var>id</var>/routes/<var>id</var>/runs/<var>id</var></tt></p>

<p>Returns an object representing the selected run.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/agencies/sf-muni/routes/J/runs/J__IBNOE.json">An unusual run for Muni's J-Church line in JSON</a></li>
</ul>





<h3>List of stops for a run</h3>

<p>URL: <tt>/agencies/<var>id</var>/routes/<var>id</var>/runs/<var>id</var>/stops</tt></p>

<p>Returns a list of stops for the selected run. The stops are returned in order
of arrival, so the first and last items in the list are the run's terminals.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/agencies/sf-muni/routes/47/runs/47_OB/stops.json">List of stops that Muni's 47-Van Ness line visits on its outbound run in JSON</a></li>
  <li><a href="/agencies/sf-muni/routes/47/runs/47_OB/stops.kml">List of stops that Muni's 47-Van Ness line visits on its outbound run in KML</a></li>
</ul>






<h3>List of vehicles on a route</h3>

<p>URL: <tt>/agencies/<var>id</var>/routes/<var>id</var>/vehicles</tt></p>

<p>Returns a list of vehicles that are currently assigned to the selected
route. Some of the returned vehicles may actually be in a depot.</p>

<p>The vehicles are returned in no particular order.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/agencies/sf-muni/routes/30/vehicles.json">Vehicles on Muni's 30-Stockton line in JSON</a></li>
  <li><a href="/agencies/sf-muni/routes/30/vehicles.kml">Vehicles on Muni's 30-Stockton line in KML</a></li>
</ul>







<h3>Properties of a specific stop</h3>

<p>URL: <tt>/agencies/<var>id</var>/stops/<var>id</var></tt></p>

<p>Returns an object representing the selected stop. Due to limitations
of the underlying NextBus data feed the location of the stop is not
available at this endpoint.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/agencies/sf-muni/stops/13996.json">A stop at Church &amp; 24th from San Francisco in JSON</a></li>
</ul>



<h3>List of routes that serve a specific stop</h3>

<p>URL: <tt>/agencies/<var>id</var>/stops/<var>id</var>/routes</tt></p>

<p>Returns a list of all routes that serve the selected stop.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/agencies/sf-muni/stops/15417/routes.json">Routes serving Powell Muni Station in JSON</a></li>
</ul>




<h3>List of predicted arrivals for a specific stop</h3>

<p>URL: <tt>/agencies/<var>id</var>/stops/<var>id</var>/predictions</tt></p>

<p>Returns a list of predicted arrivals for the selected stop across all routes.
The predictions are listed in order of expected arrival.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/agencies/sf-muni/stops/17217/predictions.json">Predicted arrivals for Embarcadero Muni Station in JSON</a></li>
</ul>




<h3>List of predicted arrivals for a specific route at specific stop</h3>

<p>URL: <tt>/agencies/<var>id</var>/stops/<var>id</var>/predictions/by-route/<var>id</var></tt></p>

<p>Returns a list of predicted arrivals for the selected stop including only
vehicles from the selected route.
The predictions are listed in order of expected arrival.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/agencies/sf-muni/stops/17217/predictions/by-route/L.json">Predicted arrivals for L-Taraval at Embarcadero Muni Station in JSON</a></li>
</ul>




<h3>List of all vehicles operated by an agency</h3>

<p>URL: <tt>/agencies/<var>id</var>/vehicles</tt></p>

<p>Returns a list of all vehicles operated by the selected agency
which are being tracked by the NextBus system.</p>

<p>In some cases vehicles show up in this list that are not
currently active on any route. These should not generally
be displayed to end-users to avoid confusion.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/agencies/sf-muni/vehicles.json">All of Muni's vehicles in JSON</a></li>
  <li><a href="/agencies/sf-muni/vehicles.kml">All of Muni's vehicles in KML</a></li>
</ul>




<h3>Properties of a specific vehicle</h3>

<p>URL: <tt>/agencies/<var>id</var>/vehicles/<var>id</var></tt></p>

<p>Returns an object representing a specific vehicle. This endpoint
will function only if the selected vehicle is being tracked
by NextBus at the time of request.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/agencies/sf-muni/vehicles/1050.json">One of Muni's historic streetcars in JSON</a></li>
  <li><a href="/agencies/sf-muni/vehicles/1050.kml">One of Muni's historic streetcars in KML</a></li>

<h2>Accuracy of Data</h2>

<p>Data retrieved from the underlying NextBus API is cached by ProximoBus. Static data including
route and stop configurations is cached for up to one week after fetch, and may therefore take
up to seven days to update when the underlying data changes. Vehicle location and preditiction
data is cached for up to 30 seconds.</p>

<p>No client should poll any ProximoBus endpoint more often than once every 30 seconds.</p>
