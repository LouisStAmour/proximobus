<h1>ProximoBus</h1>

<p>ProximoBus is an alternative API for accessing the public data
available from <a href="http://www.nextbus.com/">NextBus</a>.</p>

<p>The goal is to provide an API that is easier to use for common
use cases and that is lighter weight than the official NextBus
endpoints so that it is kinder to mobile devices.</p>

<p>For more information see <a href="/docs.html">the documentation</a>.</p>
